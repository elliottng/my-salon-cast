python -m app.mcp_server
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000` and display:
```
INFO: MySalonCast MCP Server running on http://localhost:8000
INFO: Available tools: 8 tools, 6 resources, 4 prompts
```

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop

Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop MCP settings:

**File Location:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mysaloncast": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "uvicorn", "app.mcp_server:mcp.app", "--host", "localhost", "--port", "8000"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/mysaloncast/project"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Replace `/path/to/your/mysaloncast/project` with your actual project path.

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

After saving the configuration, restart Claude Desktop. You should see "MySalonCast" appear in the MCP section.

## Security & Privacy (Claude.ai Integration)

When using MySalonCast through Claude.ai:

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes**
- MySalonCast processes URLs and PDFs you provide
- Generated content is stored temporarily in our Google Cloud Storage
- Audio files are accessible via public URLs during processing
- We follow Google Cloud security best practices
- No personal data is stored beyond the current session

### **Best Practices**
- ‚úÖ Only provide URLs to public content you're authorized to use
- ‚úÖ Review tool calls before approving audio generation
- ‚úÖ Be mindful of copyright when using commercial content
- ‚úÖ Use staging environment for testing sensitive workflows

### **Data Handling**
- **Input Processing**: URLs and PDFs are processed server-side
- **Temporary Storage**: Generated files stored in GCS buckets  
- **Public URLs**: Audio files accessible via time-limited public links
- **Cleanup**: Files automatically cleaned up based on retention policies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "MCP server not found"**
- Verify the `cwd` path in your configuration is correct
- Ensure you have activated the virtual environment
- Check that all dependencies are installed

**2. "Connection refused"**
- Make sure the MCP server is running on port 8000
- Check for port conflicts with other applications
- Verify firewall settings

**3. "Import errors"**
- Ensure all requirements are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that your virtual environment is activated
- Verify Python path includes the project directory

### Debug Mode

Start the server with debug logging:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
python -m app.mcp_server
```

### Health Check

Test server connectivity:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "services": {
    "podcast_generator": "available",
    "mcp_server": "running"
  }
}
```

## Example Workflow

Here's a complete example of using MySalonCast through Claude Desktop:

1. **Start conversation**: "I want to create a podcast from this research paper"

2. **Provide URL**: Share the URL or upload a PDF

3. **Customize**: "Use Richard Feynman and Neil deGrasse Tyson as personas, make it a long episode"

4. **Generate**: Claude will call `generate_podcast_async` and return a task ID

5. **Monitor**: "What's the status?" - Claude checks progress

6. **Access**: Once complete, "Show me the podcast details" or "Play the audio"

7. **Explore**: "What other episodes do I have?" - Browse your content library

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Personas

Create custom persona research files in `/temp_files/persona_research/` and they'll be available for podcast generation.

### Audio Settings

Modify TTS settings in `app/production_config.py`:
```python
TTS_SETTINGS = {
    "voice_name": "en-US-Neural2-J",
    "speaking_rate": 1.1,
    "pitch": 0.0
}
```

### Storage Configuration

Configure cloud storage in your environment:
```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-bucket-name"
export ENVIRONMENT="production"
```
