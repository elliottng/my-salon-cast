print("üìã EXECUTION FLOW:")
print("1. User calls generate_podcast_async via MCP")
print("2. MCP server calls _generate_podcast_internal(async_mode=True)")
print("3. This creates task_id and initial status")
print("4. In async mode, it calls task_runner.submit_task()")
print("5. submit_task() uses ThreadPoolExecutor: loop.run_in_executor()")
print("6. This runs _run_podcast_generation_sync_wrapper in a SEPARATE THREAD")
print("7. _run_podcast_generation_sync_wrapper creates a NEW EVENT LOOP")
print("8. It then calls _run_podcast_generation_async in that new loop")
print("9. _run_podcast_generation_async calls _generate_podcast_internal(async_mode=False)")
print("10. This second call to _generate_podcast_internal does the actual work")

print("\n‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL ISSUES:")
print("1. DOUBLE CALL: _generate_podcast_internal is called TWICE")
print("   - First call: Sets up async execution and returns immediately")
print("   - Second call: Does the actual work in background thread")
print("")
print("2. EVENT LOOP CONFUSION:")
print("   - Main thread has its own event loop (FastAPI/MCP)")
print("   - Background thread creates a NEW event loop")
print("   - httpx.AsyncClient might get confused about which loop to use")

print("3. STATUS MANAGEMENT:")
print("   - First call creates status with 'preprocessing_sources'")
print("   - Second call might try to update the same status")
print("   - Potential race conditions or conflicts")
print("")
print("4. THREAD-LOCAL STORAGE:")
print("   - task_id is stored in thread-local storage")
print("   - But content extraction happens in async context")
print("   - Might lose thread context during await")

print("\nüîç SPECIFIC HANG POINT:")
print("The hang occurs at: await client.get(url) in content_extractor.py")
print("This suggests the HTTP request never completes or times out properly")
print("")
print("LIKELY CAUSE:")
print("The httpx.AsyncClient is trying to use an event loop that doesn't exist")
print("or is not properly running in the background thread context.")

print("\nüí° SOLUTION OPTIONS:")
print("1. Simplify architecture - avoid double _generate_podcast_internal calls")
print("2. Use sync HTTP client in background threads")
print("3. Fix event loop management in threads")
print("4. Use asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe() instead of creating new loops")
