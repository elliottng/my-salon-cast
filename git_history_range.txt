    Fix CORS and OAuth integration for Claude.ai MCP connection
    
    ## Summary
    Comprehensive fix for CORS and OAuth issues preventing Claude.ai from connecting to the MCP server. This addresses the issue where OAuth authentication was successful but the MCP connection failed due to CORS preflight requests being blocked.
    
    ## Key Changes
    
    ### 1. Added FastAPI CORS Middleware (app/mcp_server.py)
    - Added CORSMiddleware to handle cross-origin requests from Claude.ai and MCP Inspector
    - Configured to allow origins: https://claude.ai, https://inspect.mcp.garden
    - Allows credentials, proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, OPTIONS), and necessary headers
    - Positioned before OAuth middleware to ensure CORS preflight requests are processed
    
    ### 2. Fixed OAuth Middleware for CORS Compatibility (app/oauth_middleware.py)
    - Modified OAuth middleware to bypass authentication for OPTIONS preflight requests
    - Maintains full OAuth security for all actual API requests (GET, POST)
    - Allows browsers to send CORS preflight checks without Bearer tokens
    
    ### 3. Terraform Configuration Updates (terraform/main.tf, terraform/variables.tf)
    - Removed deprecated GOOGLE_TTS_API_KEY environment variable from Cloud Run services
    - Added ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable for both staging and production
    - Cleaned up unused variable definitions
    - Fixed IAM permissions for terraform service account (roles/iam.serviceAccountUser)
    
    ### 4. Deployment Configuration
    - Created env.yaml with correct environment variables matching Terraform expectations
    - Fixed database configuration to use GCS buckets instead of local SQLite paths
    - Resolved Cloud Run deployment issues with reserved PORT environment variable
    - Ensured proper service account permissions and configuration
    
    ### 5. Testing and Validation Infrastructure
    - Added deployment scripts and configuration files for testing
    - Created CORS testing utilities
    - Updated OAuth testing script with correct service URLs
    
    ## Technical Details
    
    ### CORS Implementation
    - FastAPI CORSMiddleware handles all CORS logic
    - OPTIONS requests bypass OAuth authentication entirely
    - All other requests require valid Bearer token authentication
    - Supports credentials for OAuth flow requirements
    
    ### OAuth Flow Compatibility
    - Maintains Claude.ai OAuth 2.0 compliance
    - Authorization code flow with PKCE working correctly
    - Auto-approval for Claude.ai client ID
    - SSE transport configuration for MCP protocol
    
    ### Environment Configuration
    - Staging: https://mcp-server-staging-644248751086.us-west1.run.app
    - Environment variables properly configured for GCS storage
    - Database using Cloud Storage buckets instead of local SQLite
    
    ## Deployment Status
    ‚úÖ Successfully deployed to Cloud Run staging environment
    ‚úÖ CORS preflight requests now return HTTP 200 with proper headers
    ‚úÖ OAuth authentication flow continues to work correctly
    ‚úÖ Service starts successfully with correct environment configuration
    
    ## Outstanding Validation
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  Claude.ai integration not yet tested/validated
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  inspect.mcp.garden integration not yet tested/validated

    Deep investigation into Claude.ai MCP SSE connection issue
    
    ## Problem
    Claude.ai successfully completes OAuth but never attempts to connect to the SSE endpoint, despite the manifest correctly advertising it.
    
    ## Investigation Summary
    
    ### 1. Transport Protocol Analysis
    - Initially tried switching to streamable-http transport (not yet supported by Claude.ai)
    - Reverted to SSE transport per Anthropic documentation
    - Confirmed SSE is the correct transport for Claude.ai integration
    
    ### 2. Route Conflict Discovery & Resolution
    - Found custom SSE handler (119 lines) conflicting with FastMCP's built-in SSE transport
    - FastMCP with transport='sse' automatically creates /sse and /messages endpoints
    - Removed custom handler to use FastMCP's built-in implementation
    - Verified OAuth middleware correctly protects all MCP endpoints
    
    ### 3. Deep Dive into FastMCP Source Code
    - Located MCP SSE implementation in venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/mcp/server/sse.py
    - Confirmed FastMCP correctly sends initial 'endpoint' event:
      event: endpoint
      data: /messages?session_id={uuid}
    - This matches the protocol requirements from working examples
    
    ### 4. Current Status
    ‚úÖ OAuth flow completes successfully
    ‚úÖ Manifest correctly advertises SSE endpoint at /sse
    ‚úÖ SSE endpoint returns 401 without Bearer token (OAuth working)
    ‚úÖ FastMCP handles all JSON-RPC and SSE protocol internally
    ‚ùå Claude.ai reads manifest but never attempts SSE connection
    
    ### 5. Deployment Status
    - Staging: https://mcp-server-staging-644248751086.us-west1.run.app
    - Production: https://mcp-server-prod-644248751086.us-west1.run.app
    - Both environments configured with proper OAuth and SSE endpoints
    
    ## Key Findings
    The fact that Claude.ai doesn't even attempt the SSE connection suggests the issue is NOT with our SSE implementation, but with something Claude.ai validates BEFORE attempting connection. FastMCP's implementation follows the MCP specification correctly.
    
    ## Test Utilities Added
    - test_sse.py: Simple script to test SSE endpoint behavior
    - Confirms 401 response without auth (OAuth protection working)

    Fix MCP integration test timing and persona ID format
    
    - Modified step3_monitor_progress to wait for full task completion ('completed' status) instead of stopping at 'generating_outline'
    - Removed redundant monitoring steps (step5 and step7) that caused duplicate polling
    - Added streamlined step8_get_final_content for clean resource access after completion
    - Fixed persona ID format from hyphens to underscores (alan-turing ‚Üí alan_turing) to match server-generated IDs
    - Integration test now successfully completes full podcast generation workflow (190s, 100% completion)
    - Validates proper MCP client behavior: wait for completion before accessing episode resources
    - Resolves intermittent 'Podcast episode not available' errors due to premature resource access

    ‚úÖ Enhanced TTS Health Monitoring:
    - Added comprehensive TTS metrics collection with thread pool monitoring
    - Implemented real-time health status reporting (degraded ‚Üí healthy)
    - Added TtsMetrics class with recent activity tracking and performance analytics
    - Fixed thread pool lifecycle management with graceful executor recreation
    
    ‚úÖ MCP Health Integration:
    - Added get_service_health MCP tool for production monitoring
    - Added test_tts_service MCP tool for health validation testing
    - Proper context (ctx) flow from MCP client to server
    - Health metrics accurately reflect TTS operations within MCP server process
    
    ‚úÖ Production-Ready Features:
    - 16 TTS workers supporting ~4 concurrent podcast workflows
    - Thread-safe metrics calculation with multiple Python version support

    Fix MCP Context parameter usage according to FastMCP specification
    
    - Fixed get_persona_research_resource calls to remove ctx parameter
    - MCP resources don't use ctx, only MCP tools do per FastMCP design
    - Integration test now passes full workflow validation
    - Increased LLM timeouts for better API reliability
    - Updated TTS voice cache
    
    This resolves the 'unexpected keyword argument ctx' error and aligns
    with proper FastMCP patterns where tools use context but resources are
    simple data access functions.

    Fix TTS service async thread pool shutdown errors
    
    - Added shared ThreadPoolExecutor singleton to prevent premature shutdown
    - Replaced asyncio.to_thread with functools.partial + asyncio.wrap_future
    - Eliminates 'cannot schedule new futures after shutdown' errors
    - Enables stable sequential TTS audio generation
    - Integration test now progresses past audio generation phase

    Fix MCP integration test status polling premature failures
    
    - Fixed overly aggressive error detection in step3_poll_status_until_personas
    - Changed from string-based error detection to precise field-based validation
    - Now checks for explicit status failures (failed/cancelled/error) and actual error messages
    - Fixed content extractor async client shutdown issue with singleton pattern
    - Updated .gitignore to exclude security documentation
    
    The test now progresses past status polling stage successfully, addressing the false positive failures when status messages contained words like 'error' in logs or metadata.
