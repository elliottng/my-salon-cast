    <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
    
    <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely held as one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics.</p>
    
    <p>His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc² has been called "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</p>
    
    <p>Einstein was born in the German Empire but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to Berlin where he was made a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.</p>
    
    <p>In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, who was Jewish, was targeted by the Nazi regime, and his property was confiscated. He emigrated to the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.</p>
    
    <p>Einstein's scientific achievements include the special theory of relativity (1905), the general theory of relativity (1915), and his work on the photoelectric effect. His theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity.</p>
    
    <p>Beyond science, Einstein was also known for his humanitarian efforts and philosophical views. He was a pacifist who later advocated for nuclear disarmament after witnessing the atomic bombings of Japan. Einstein died in Princeton, New Jersey, on April 18, 1955.</p>
