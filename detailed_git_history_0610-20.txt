    Fix: Podcast audio streaming endpoint and cloud storage integration
    
    ## 🎯 Main Fix: Audio Streaming Endpoint
    - Fixed /podcast/{task_id}/audio endpoint to properly serve generated podcast audio
    - Changed URL parameter from 'podcast_id' to 'task_id' for API consistency
    - Added robust error handling for missing tasks and inaccessible files
    - Implemented gs:// URL to public HTTPS URL conversion for browser compatibility
    
    ## 🔧 Technical Changes:
    
    ### app/main.py (Audio Endpoint):
    - Retrieve audio file path from task status instead of hardcoded paths
    - Convert gs:// URLs to https://storage.googleapis.com/... for browser playback
    - Enhanced error messages and status validation
    - Added HTML audio player with podcast metadata display
    
    ### app/storage.py (Cloud Storage):
    - Enable cloud storage initialization in local Docker environments
    - Remove local environment restriction for blob.make_public()
    - Return public HTTPS URLs instead of gs:// URLs for local environments
    - Support credentials-based storage detection: project_id + audio_bucket + credentials
    
    ### app/podcast_workflow.py (Workflow):
    - Add local file copying fallback for environments without cloud storage
    - Enhanced storage operation error handling
    - Support both cloud and local storage completion paths
    
    ## 📚 Documentation Updates (11 files):
    - Updated OpenAPI schemas (openapi.json, openapi_chatgpt.json)
    - Refreshed API documentation (docs/api_documentation.html)
    - Updated quick reference (docs/openapi_quick_reference.md)
    - Fixed architecture docs (ARCHITECTURE.md)
    - Updated ChatGPT setup guide (docs/chatgpt_customgpt_setup.md)
    - Corrected local testing instructions (DOCKER_TEST.md)
    - Enhanced test script (test_api_local.py) with consistent task_id usage
    
    ## 🧪 Testing Results:
    ✅ Generated 8-minute podcast with 3 personas successfully
    ✅ Audio uploaded to Google Cloud Storage with public access
    ✅ Browser audio player working with embedded controls and download
    ✅ Direct MP3 URL accessible: https://storage.googleapis.com/...
    ✅ Complete workflow: generation → upload → serving → playback
    
    ## 🚀 Production Impact:
    - Local Docker environment now mirrors production cloud behavior exactly
    - Audio streaming endpoint ready for production deployment
    - API consistency achieved across all endpoints (task_id everywhere)
    - Enhanced debugging capabilities for cloud storage issues
    
    Breaking Change: Audio endpoint URL parameter changed from 'podcast_id' to 'task_id'
    Migration: Update any existing integrations to use /podcast/{task_id}/audio

    feat: streamline deployment pipeline and add automated deployment script
    
    - Move `.env.test` to `.env.template`. - Update .dockerignore to allow
    README.md (required by pyproject.toml). - Update README with simplified
    deployment instructions using new script. Successfully deploy to Cloud
    Run with full API functionality. - Simplify deployment configuration by
    updating Dockerfile to use single-stage build without BuildKit
    dependencies for Cloud Build compatibility. This was causing errors
    before. - Update cloudbuild.yaml with comprehensive environment variable
    support for GEMINI_API_KEY, FIRECRAWL_API_KEY, and deployment
    configuration. - Add `/health` endpoint for monitoring. - Create
    automated deployment script (scripts/deploy.sh) that loads environment
    variables from .env file automatically and deploys to Cloud Run.
